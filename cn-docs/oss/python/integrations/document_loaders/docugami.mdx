本笔记本介绍了如何从 `Docugami` 加载文档。它阐述了使用此系统相较于其他数据加载器的优势。

## 前提条件

1.  安装必要的 Python 包。
2.  获取您工作区的访问令牌，并确保其已设置为 `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` 环境变量。
3.  获取一些已处理文档的文档集和文档 ID，具体说明请参见：[help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)

```python
# You need the dgml-utils package to use the DocugamiLoader (run pip install directly without "poetry run" if you are not using poetry)
!poetry run pip install docugami-langchain dgml-utils==0.3.0 --upgrade --quiet
```

## 快速开始

1.  创建一个 [Docugami 工作区](http://www.docugami.com)（提供免费试用）。
2.  添加您的文档（PDF、DOCX 或 DOC），并允许 Docugami 摄取它们并将其聚类成相似的文档集，例如 NDA、租赁协议和服务协议。系统支持的文档类型没有固定集合，创建的聚类取决于您的特定文档，您之后可以[更改文档集分配](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view)。
3.  通过您工作区的开发者平台创建一个访问令牌。[详细说明](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)
4.  探索 [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) 以获取您已处理的文档集 ID 列表，或仅获取特定文档集的文档 ID。
5.  使用如下详述的 DocugamiLoader，为您的文档获取丰富的语义块。
6.  （可选）构建并发布一个或多个[报告或摘要](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports)。这有助于 Docugami 根据您的偏好，使用更好的标签改进语义 XML，然后这些标签会作为元数据添加到 DocugamiLoader 的输出中。使用自查询检索器等技术进行高精度的文档问答。

## 与其他分块技术相比的优势

对文档进行适当的分块对于从文档中检索信息至关重要。存在许多分块技术，包括依赖空白的简单分块和基于字符长度的递归分块拆分。Docugami 提供了一种不同的方法：

1.  **智能分块：** Docugami 将每个文档分解为不同大小块的分层语义 XML 树，从单个单词或数值到整个章节。这些块遵循文档的语义轮廓，提供了比任意长度或简单的基于空白的分块更有意义的表示。
2.  **语义标注：** 块被标注了在文档集中保持一致的语义标签，便于跨多个文档进行一致的分层查询，即使这些文档的编写和格式不同。例如，在一组租赁协议中，您可以轻松识别关键条款，如房东、租户或续租日期，以及更复杂的信息，例如任何转租条款的措辞，或特定司法管辖区在终止条款中是否有例外部分。
3.  **结构化表示：** 此外，XML 树使用表示标题、段落、列表、表格和其他常见元素的属性来指示每个文档的结构轮廓，并在所有支持的文档格式（如扫描的 PDF 或 DOCX 文件）中保持一致。它适当地处理了长文档的特性，如页眉/页脚或多列流，以实现干净的文本提取。
4.  **附加元数据：** 如果用户一直在使用 Docugami，块还会被标注附加的元数据。这些附加元数据可用于进行不受上下文窗口限制的高精度文档问答。请参阅下面的详细代码演练。

```python
import os

from docugami_langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
```

## 加载文档

如果设置了 DOCUGAMI_API_KEY 环境变量，则无需显式传递给加载器；否则，您可以将其作为 `access_token` 参数传入。

```python
DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("DOCUGAMI_API_KEY")
```

```python
docset_id = "26xpy3aes7xp"
document_ids = ["d7jqdzcj50sj", "cgd1eacfkchw"]

# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_ids
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=docset_id, document_ids=document_ids)
chunks = loader.load()
len(chunks)
```

```text
120
```

每个 @[`Document`]（实际上是实际 PDF、DOC 或 DOCX 的一个块）的 `metadata` 包含一些有用的附加信息：

1.  **id 和 source：** 块在 Docugami 中来源的文件（PDF、DOC 或 DOCX）的 ID 和名称。
2.  **xpath：** 块在文档 XML 表示中的 XPath。对于直接引用文档 XML 中实际块的来源引用非常有用。
3.  **structure：** 块的结构属性，例如 h1、h2、div、table、td 等。如果调用者需要，可用于过滤掉某些类型的块。
4.  **tag：** 块的语义标签，使用各种生成式和抽取式技术。更多细节请参见：[github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks](https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks)

您可以通过在 `DocugamiLoader` 实例上设置以下属性来控制分块行为：

1.  您可以设置最小和最大块大小，系统会尽量遵守并最小化截断。您可以设置 `loader.min_text_length` 和 `loader.max_text_length` 来控制这些。
2.  默认情况下，只返回块的文本。但是，Docugami 的 XML 知识图谱包含额外的丰富信息，包括块内实体的语义标签。如果您希望在返回的块上获得额外的 xml 元数据，请设置 `loader.include_xml_tags = True`。
3.  此外，如果您希望 Docugami 在其返回的块中包含父块，可以设置 `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels`。子块通过 `loader.parent_id_key` 值指向父块。这对于例如使用 MultiVector Retriever 进行[从小到大的检索](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg)非常有用。请参阅本笔记本后面的详细示例。

```python
loader.min_text_length = 64
loader.include_xml_tags = True
chunks = loader.load()

for chunk in chunks[:5]:
    print(chunk)
```

## 基本用法：用于文档问答的 Docugami 加载器

您可以像使用标准加载器一样使用 Docugami Loader 对多个文档进行问答，只不过其块遵循文档的自然轮廓，效果更好。关于如何做到这一点有很多很好的教程，例如[这个](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0)。我们可以使用相同的代码，但使用 `DocugamiLoader` 来获得更好的分块效果，而不是使用基本的分割技术直接加载文本或 PDF 文件。

```python
!poetry run pip install -U langchain-openai tiktoken langchain-chroma hnswlib
```

```python
# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
chunks = loader.load()

# strip semantic metadata intentionally, to test how things work without semantic metadata
for chunk in chunks:
    stripped_metadata = chunk.metadata.copy()
    for key in chunk.metadata:
        if key not in ["name", "xpath", "id", "structure"]:
            # remove semantic metadata
            del stripped_metadata[key]
    chunk.metadata = stripped_metadata

print(len(chunks))
```

```text
4674
```

加载器返回的文档已经分割好，因此我们不需要使用文本分割器。可选地，我们可以使用每个文档上的元数据，例如结构或标签属性，进行我们想要的任何后处理。

我们将直接按原样使用 `DocugamiLoader` 的输出，以通常的方式设置检索问答链。

```python
from langchain_classic.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embedding)
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)
```

```python
# Try out the retriever with an example query
qa_chain("What can tenants do with signage on their properties?")
```

## 使用 docugami 知识图谱进行高精度文档问答

大型文档的一个问题是，您问题的正确答案可能依赖于文档中相距很远的块。典型的分块技术，即使有重叠，也难以向 LLM 提供足够的上下文来回答此类问题。随着即将出现的超大上下文 LLM，可能可以将大量标记（甚至整个文档）塞入上下文中，但对于非常长的文档或大量文档，这仍然会在某个时刻达到极限。

例如，如果我们提出一个更复杂的问题，需要 LLM 利用文档不同部分的块，即使是 OpenAI 强大的 LLM 也无法正确回答。

```python
chain_response = qa_chain("What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?")
chain_response["result"]  # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft
```

```text
" I don't know."
```

```python
chain_response["source_documents"]
```

```python
[Document(page_content='1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises.', metadata={'id': '5b39a1ae84d51682328dca1467be211f', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_WA.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1', 'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/docset:BasicLeaseInformation/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS-section/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS/docset:CatalystGroup/dg:chunk[6]/dg:chunk'}),
 Document(page_content='1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises.', metadata={'id': '5b39a1ae84d51682328dca1467be211f', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_AZ.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1', 'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/docset:BasicLeaseInformation/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS-section/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS/docset:MenloGroup/dg:chunk[6]/dg:chunk'}),
 Document(page_content='1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises.', metadata={'id': '5b39a1ae84d51682328dca1467be211f', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_FL.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1', 'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/docset:Florida-section/docset:Florida/docset:Shorebucks/dg:chunk[5]/dg:chunk'}),
 Document(page_content='1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises.', metadata={'id': '5b39a1ae84d51682328dca1467be211f', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_TX.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1', 'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/docset:BasicLeaseInformation/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS-section/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS/docset:LandmarkLlc/dg:chunk[6]/dg:chunk'})]
```

乍一看，答案似乎合理，但它是错误的。如果您仔细查看此答案的源块，您会发现文档的分块最终没有将房东姓名和可出租面积放在同一个上下文中，并产生了不相关的块，因此答案是错误的（应为 **13,500 平方英尺**）。

Docugami 可以在这里提供帮助。如果用户一直在[使用 Docugami](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports)，块会被标注使用不同技术创建的附加元数据。稍后将添加更多技术方法。

具体来说，让我们要求 Docugami 在其输出上返回 XML 标签以及附加元数据：

```python
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
loader.include_xml_tags = (
    True  # for additional semantics from the Docugami knowledge graph
)
chunks = loader.load()
print(chunks[0].metadata)

我们可以使用自查询检索器，利用这些附加元数据来提高查询准确性：

```python
!poetry run pip install -U lark --quiet
```

```python
from langchain_classic.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain_classic.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

EXCLUDE_KEYS = ["id", "xpath", "structure"]
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name=key,
        description=f"The {key} for this chunk",
        type="string",
    )
    for key in chunks[0].metadata
    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]

document_content_description = "Contents of this chunk"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

让我们再次运行相同的问题。它返回了正确的结果，因为所有块都有元数据键/值对，携带了关于文档的关键信息，即使这些信息在物理上距离用于生成答案的源块非常远。

```python

这次答案是正确的，因为自查询检索器在元数据的 landlord 属性上创建了一个过滤器，正确地过滤到专门关于 DHA Group 房东的文档。由此产生的源块都与该房东相关，这提高了答案的准确性，即使房东并未在包含正确答案的特定块中直接提及。

# 高级主题：利用文档知识图谱层次结构进行从小到大的检索

文档本质上是半结构化的，DocugamiLoader 能够导航文档的语义和结构轮廓，在其返回的块上提供父块引用。这对于例如使用 MultiVector Retriever 进行[从小到大的检索](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg)非常有用。

要获取父块引用，您可以将 `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels` 设置为非零值。

```python
from typing import Dict, List

from docugami_langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
from langchain_core.documents import Document

loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
loader.include_xml_tags = (
    True  # for additional semantics from the Docugami knowledge graph
)
loader.parent_hierarchy_levels = 3  # for expanded context
loader.max_text_length = (
    1024 * 8
)  # 8K chars are roughly 2K tokens (ref: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)
loader.include_project_metadata_in_doc_metadata = (
    False  # Not filtering on vector metadata, so remove to lighten the vectors
)
chunks: List[Document] = loader.load()

# build separate maps of parent and child chunks
parents_by_id: Dict[str, Document] = {}
children_by_id: Dict[str, Document] = {}
for chunk in chunks:
    chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get("id")
    parent_chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get(loader.parent_id_key)
    if not parent_chunk_id:
        # parent chunk
        parents_by_id[chunk_id] = chunk
    else:
        # child chunk
        children_by_id[chunk_id] = chunk
```

```python
# Explore some of the parent chunk relationships
for id, chunk in list(children_by_id.items())[:5]:
    parent_chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get(loader.parent_id_key)
    if parent_chunk_id:
        # child chunks have the parent chunk id set
        print(f"PARENT CHUNK {parent_chunk_id}: {parents_by_id[parent_chunk_id]}")

21. SERVICES AND UTILITIES.
 <SERVICESANDUTILITIES>Landlord shall have no obligation to provide any utilities or services to the Premises other than passenger elevator service to the Premises. Tenant shall be solely responsible for and shall promptly pay all charges for water, electricity, or any other utility used or consumed in the Premises, including all costs associated with separately metering for the Premises. Tenant shall be responsible for repairs and maintenance to exit lighting, emergency lighting, and fire extinguishers for the Premises. Tenant is responsible for interior janitorial, pest control, and waste removal services. Landlord may at any time change the electrical utility provider for the Building. Tenant’s use of electrical, HVAC, or other services furnished by Landlord shall not exceed, either in voltage, rated capacity, use, or overall load, that which Landlord deems to be standard for the Building. In no event shall Landlord be liable for damages resulting from the failure to furnish any service, and any interruption or failure shall in no manner entitle Tenant to any remedies including abatement of Rent. If at any time during the Lease Term the Project has any type of card access system for the Parking Areas or the Building, Tenant shall purchase access cards for all occupants of the Premises from Landlord at a Building Standard charge and shall comply with Building Standard terms relating to access to the Parking Areas and the Building. </SERVICESANDUTILITIES>

 <SECURITYDEPOSIT>The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for Tenant's full and faithful performance of this Lease including the payment of Rent. Tenant grants Landlord a security interest in the Security Deposit. The Security Deposit may be commingled with other funds of Landlord and Landlord shall have no liability for payment of any interest on the Security Deposit. Landlord may apply the Security Deposit to the extent required to cure any default by Tenant. If Landlord so applies the Security Deposit, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the amount necessary to replenish the Security Deposit to its original sum within <Deliver>five days </Deliver>after notice from Landlord. The Security Deposit shall not be deemed an advance payment of Rent or a measure of damages for any default by Tenant, nor shall it be a defense to any action that Landlord may bring against Tenant. </SECURITYDEPOSIT>
23. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS.
 <GOVERNMENTALREGULATIONS>Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall promptly comply (and shall cause all subtenants and licensees to comply) with all laws, codes, and ordinances of governmental authorities, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of <AmericanswithDisabilitiesActDate>1990 </AmericanswithDisabilitiesActDate>as amended (the "ADA"), and all recorded covenants and restrictions affecting the Project, pertaining to Tenant, its conduct of business, and its use and occupancy of the Premises, including the performance of any work to the Common Areas required because of Tenant's specific use (as opposed to general office use) of the Premises or Alterations to the Premises made by Tenant. </GOVERNMENTALREGULATIONS>
24. SIGNS.
