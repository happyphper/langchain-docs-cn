The modern\nfanciful story is here placed next to the real folk story instead of\nafter all the groups of folk products. The Hebrew stories at the\nbeginning belong quite as well, perhaps even better, in Section V, while\nthe stories at the end of Section VI shade off into the more modern\ntypes of short tales. Then the fact that other groups of modern stories\nare to follow later, illustrating more realistic studies of life and the\nvery recent and remarkably numerous writings centering around animal\nlife, limits the list here. Many of the animal stories might, with equal\npropriety, be placed under the head of the fantastic.\n\nThe child\'s natural literature. The\nworld has lost certain secrets as the price of an advancing\ncivilization. It is a commonplace of observation that no one can\nduplicate the success of Mother Goose, whether she be thought of as the\nmaker of jingles or the teller of tales. The conditions of modern life\npreclude the generally naïve attitude that produced the folk rhymes,\nballads, tales, proverbs, fables, and myths. The folk saw things simply\nand directly. The complex, analytic, questioning mind is not yet, either\nin or out of stories. The motives from which people act are to them\nplain and not mixed. Characters are good or bad. They feel no need of\nelaborately explaining their joys and sorrows. Such experiences come\nwith the day\'s work. "To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new." The\nzest of life with them is emphatic. Their humor is fresh, unbounded,\nsincere; there is no trace of cynicism. In folk literature we do not\nfeel the presence of a "writer" who is mightily concerned about\nmaintaining his reputation for wisdom, originality, or style. Hence the\nfreedom from any note of straining after effect, of artificiality. In\nthe midst of a life limited to fundamental needs, their literature deals\nwith fundamentals. On the whole, it was a literature for entertainment.\nA more learned upper class may have concerned itself then about\n"problems" and "purposes," as the whole world does now, but the\nliterature of the folk had no such interests.\n\nWithout discussing the limits of the culture-epoch theory of human\ndevelopment as a complete guide in education, it is clear that the young\nchild passes through a period when his mind looks out upon the world in\na manner analogous to that of the folk as expressed in their literature.\nQuarrel with the fact as we may, it still remains a fact that his nature\ncraves these old stories and will not be satisfied with something "just\nas good."\n\nThe modern fairy story. The advance\nof civilization has been accompanied by a wistful longing for the\nsimplicities left by the way. In some periods this interest in the past\nhas been more marked than in others. When the machinery of life has\nweighed too heavily on the human spirit, men have turned for relief to a\ncontemplation of the "good old times" and have preached crusades of a\n"return to nature." 172 Many modern writers have tried to recapture some\nof the power of the folk tale by imitating its method. In many cases\nthey have had a fair degree of success: in one case, that of Hans\nChristian Andersen, the success is admittedly very complete. As a rule,\nhowever, the sharpness of the sense of wonder has been blunted, and many\nimitators of the old fairy tale succeed in keeping only the shell.\nAnother class of modern fantastic tale is that of the pourquoi story, which has the explanation of something\nas its object. Such tales grow out of the attempt to use the charm of\nold stories as a means of conveying instruction, somewhat after the\nmethod of those parents who covered up our bitter medicine with some of\nour favorite jam. Even "Little Red Riding Hood," as we saw, has been\nturned into a flower myth. So compelling is this pedagogical motive that\nso-called nature myths have been invented or made from existing stories\nin great numbers. The practical results please many teachers, but it may\nbe questioned whether the gain is sufficient to compensate children for\nthe distorting results upon masterpieces.\n\nWide range of the modern fairy tale.\nThe bibliography will suggest something of the treasures in the field of\nthe modern fanciful story. From the delightful nonsense of Alice\nin Wonderland and the "travelers\' tales" of Baron\nMunchausen to the profound seriousness of The King of the\nGolden River and Why the Chimes Rang is a far cry.\nThere are the rich fancies of Barrie and Maeterlinck, at the same time\ndelicate as the promises of spring and brilliant as the fruitions of\nsummer. One may be blown away to the land of Oz, he may lose his shadow\nwith Peter Schlemihl, he may outdo the magic carpet with his\nTraveling-Cloak, he may visit the courts of kings with his Wonderful\nChair; Miss Muffet will invite us to her Christmas party, Lemuel\nGulliver will lead us to lands not marked in the school atlas; on every\nside is a world of wonder.\n\nSome qualities of these modern tales.\nEvery age produces after its own fashion, and we must expect to find the\nmodern user of the fairy-story method expressing through it the\nqualities of his own outlook upon the world. Interest in the picturesque\naspects of landscape will be emphasized, as in the early portions of\n"The Story of Fairyfoot" and, with especial magnificence of style,\nthroughout The King of the Golden River. There will appear\nthe saddened mood of the modern in the face of the human miseries that\nmake happiness a mockery, as in "The Happy Prince." The destructive\neffects of the possessive instinct upon all that is finest in human\nnature is reflected in "The Prince\'s Dream." That the most valuable\nefforts are often those performed with least spectacular settings may be\ndiscerned in "The Knights of the Silver Shield," while the lesson of\nkindly helpfulness is the burden of "Old Pipes and the Dryad." In many\nmodern stories the reader is too much aware of the conscious efforts of\nstyle and structure. The thoughtful child will sometimes be too much\ndistressed by the more somber modern story, and should not hear too many\nof the gloomy type.\n\nAndersen the consummate master. Hans\nChristian Andersen is the acknowledged master of the modern story for\nchildren. What are the sources of his success? Genius is always\nunexplainable except in terms of itself, but some things are clear. To\nbegin, he makes a mark—drives down a peg: "There came a soldier marching\nalong 173 the high road—one, two! one, two!" and\nyou are off. No backing and filling, no jockeying for position, no\nelaborate setting of the stage. The story\'s the thing! Next, the\nlanguage is the language of common oral speech, free and unrestrained.\nThe rigid forms of the grammar are eschewed. There is no beating around\nthe bush. Seeing through the eyes of the child, he uses the language\nthat is natural to such sight: "Aha! there sat the dog with eyes as big\nas mill-wheels." In quick dramatic fashion the story unrolls before your\nvision: "So the soldier cut the witch\'s head off. There she lay!" No\nagonizing over the cruelty of it, the lack of sympathy. It is a joke\nafter the child\'s own heart, and with a hearty laugh at this end to an\nimpostor, the listener is on with the story. The logic is the logic of\nchildhood: "And everyone could see she was a real princess, for she was\nso lovely." When Andersen deals with some of the deeper truths of\nexistence, as in "The Nightingale" or "The Ugly Duckling," he still\nmanages to throw it all into the form that is natural and convincing and\nsimple to the child. He never mounts a pedestal and becomes a grown-up\nphilosopher. Perhaps Andersen\'s secret lay in the fact that some fairy\ngodmother invested him at birth with a power to see things so completely\nas a child sees them that he never questioned the dignity of the method.\nIn few of his stories is there any evidence of a constraint due to a\nconscious attempt to write down to the understandings of children.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR READING\n\nThe most valuable discussion of the difficulties to be mastered in\nwriting the literary fairy tale, and the story of the only very complete\nmastery yet made, will be found in the account of Hans Christian\nAndersen in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century, by\nGeorg Brandes. Now and then hints of importance on such stories and\ntheir value for children may be found in biographies of the more\nprominent writers represented in the section and mentioned in the\nbibliography, and in magazine articles and reviews. These latter may be\nlocated by use of the periodical indexes found in most libraries. For\nthe proper attitude which the schools should have toward fiction and\nfanciful writing in general, nothing could be better than two lectures\non "Children\'s Reading," in On the Art of Reading, by Sir\nArthur Quiller-Couch.\n\n174\n\n190\n\nThe rabbis of old were good story-tellers. They were essentially\nteachers and they understood that the best sermon is a story. "They were\nfond of the parable, the anecdote, the apt illustration, and their\nlegends that have been transmitted to us, all aglow with the light and\nlife of the Orient, possess perennial charm." It is possible to find in\nrabbinical sources a large number of brief stories that have the power\nof entertaining as well as of emphasizing some qualities of character\nthat are important in all ages. The plan of this book does not include\nthe wonderful stories of the Old Testament, which are easy of access to\nany teacher and may be used as experience directs. The Hebrew stories\nfollowing correspond very nearly to the folk anecdote and are placed in\nthis section because of their literary form.\n\nDr. Abram S. Isaacs (1851—) is a professor in New York University and\nis also a rabbi. The selection that follows is from his Stories\nfrom the Rabbis. (Copyrighted. Used by special permission of The\nBloch Publishing Company, New York.) Taking advantage of the popular\nsuperstition that a four-leaved clover is a sign of good luck, Dr.\nIsaacs has grouped together four parable-like stories, each of which\ndeals with wealth as a subject. The editors are responsible for the\nspecial titles given. The messages of these stories might be summarized\nas follows: If you would be lucky, (1) be honest because it is right to\nbe honest, (2) value good friends more highly than gold, (3) let love\naccompany each gift of charity, and (4) use common sense in your\nbusiness ventures.\n\nA FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER\n\nABRAM S. ISAACS\n\n1. The Rabbi and The Diadem\n\nGreat was the alarm in the palace of Rome, which soon spread\nthroughout the entire city. The Empress had lost her costly diadem, and\nit could not be found. They searched in every direction, but it was all\nin vain. Half distracted, for the mishap boded no good to her or her\nhouse, the Empress redoubled her exertions to regain her precious\npossession, but without result. As a last resource it was proclaimed in\nthe public streets:\n\n"The Empress has lost a priceless diadem. Whoever restores it within\nthirty days shall receive a princely reward. But he who delays, and\nbrings it after thirty days, shall lose his head."\n\nIn those times all nationalities flocked toward Rome; all classes and\ncreeds could be met in its stately halls and crowded thoroughfares.\nAmong the rest was a rabbi, a learnèd sage from the East, who loved\ngoodness and lived a righteous life, in the stir and turmoil of the\nWestern world. It chanced one night as he was strolling up and down, in\nbusy meditation, beneath the clear, moonlit sky, he saw the diadem\nsparkling at his feet. He seized it quickly, brought it to his dwelling,\nwhere he guarded it carefully until the thirty days had expired, when he\nresolved to return it to the owner.\n\nHe proceeded to the palace, and, undismayed at sight of long lines of\nsoldiery and officials, asked for an audience with the Empress.\n\n"What dost thou mean by this?" she inquired, when he told her his\nstory and gave her the diadem. "Why didst thou delay until this hour?\nDost thou know the penalty? Thy head must be forfeited."\
