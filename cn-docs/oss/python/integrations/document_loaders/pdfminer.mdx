Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\n\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis · Deep Learning · Layout Analysis\n· Character Recognition · Open Source library · Toolkit.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [11,\n\x0c2\n\nZ. Shen et al.\n\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\nmanual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\n\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\nis built with the following components:\n\n1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\n\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\n\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\n\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\n\n3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\n\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\n\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\n\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\n\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com-\nputer vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show\nLayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects\n\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\n\n3\n\nthat require precision, eﬃciency, and robustness, as well as simple and light-\nweight document processing tasks focusing on eﬃcacy and ﬂexibility (Section 5).\nLayoutParser is being actively maintained, and support for more deep learning\nmodels and novel methods in text-based layout analysis methods [37, 34] is\nplanned.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview\nof related work. The core LayoutParser library, DL Model Zoo, and customized\nmodel training are described in Section 3, and the DL model hub and commu-\nnity platform are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 shows two examples of how\nLayoutParser can be used in practical DIA projects, and Section 6 concludes.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nRecently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\n\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\n\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL. Libraries like Dectectron2 [35],\n\n6 The number shown is obtained by specifying the search type as ‘code’.\n7 https://ocr-d.de/en/about\n8 https://github.com/BobLd/DocumentLayoutAnalysis\n9 https://github.com/leonlulu/DeepLayout\n10 https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2\n11 https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR\n12 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR\n\x0c4\n\nZ. Shen et al.\n\nFig. 1: The overall architecture of LayoutParser. For an input document image,\nthe core LayoutParser library provides a set of oﬀ-the-shelf tools for layout\ndetection, OCR, visualization, and storage, backed by a carefully designed layout\ndata structure. LayoutParser also supports high level customization via eﬃcient\nlayout annotation and model training functions. These improve model accuracy\non the target samples. The community platform enables the easy sharing of DIA\nmodels and whole digitization pipelines to promote reusability and reproducibility.\nA collection of detailed documentation, tutorials and exemplar projects make\nLayoutParser easy to learn and use.\n\nAllenNLP [8] and transformers [34] have provided the community with complete\nDL-based support for developing and deploying models for general computer\nvision and natural language processing problems. LayoutParser, on the other\nhand, specializes speciﬁcally in DIA tasks. LayoutParser is also equipped with a\ncommunity platform inspired by established model hubs such as Torch Hub [23]\nand TensorFlow Hub [1]. It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as\nfull document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.\n\nThere have been a variety of document data collections to facilitate the\ndevelopment of DL models. Some examples include PRImA [3](magazine layouts),\nPubLayNet [38](academic paper layouts), Table Bank [18](tables in academic\npapers), Newspaper Navigator Dataset [16, 17](newspaper ﬁgure layouts) and\nHJDataset [31](historical Japanese document layouts). A spectrum of models\ntrained on these datasets are currently available in the LayoutParser model zoo\nto support diﬀerent use cases.\n\n3 The Core LayoutParser Library\n\nAt the core of LayoutParser is an oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit that streamlines DL-\nbased document image analysis. Five components support a simple interface\nwith comprehensive functionalities: 1) The layout detection models enable using\npre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines\nof code. 2) The detected layout information is stored in carefully engineered\n\nEfficient Data AnnotationCustomized Model TrainingModel CustomizationDIA Model HubDIA Pipeline SharingCommunity PlatformLayout Detection ModelsDocument Images The Core LayoutParser LibraryOCR ModuleStorage & VisualizationLayout Data Structure\n\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\n\n5\n\nTable 1: Current layout detection models in the LayoutParser model zoo\n\nDataset\n\nBase Model1 Large Model Notes\n\nPubLayNet [38]\nPRImA [3]\nNewspaper [17]\nTableBank [18]\nHJDataset [31]\n\nF / M\nM\nF\nF\nF / M\n\nM\n-\n-\nF\n-\n\nLayouts of modern scientiﬁc documents\nLayouts of scanned modern magazines and scientiﬁc reports\nLayouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century\nTable region on modern scientiﬁc and business document\nLayouts of history Japanese documents\n\n1 For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy\nvs. computational cost). For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101\nbackbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask\nR-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained\nusing the ResNet 101 backbone. The platform is maintained and a number of additions will be made to the model\nzoo in coming months.\n\nlayout data structures, which are optimized for eﬃciency and versatility. 3) When\nnecessary, users can employ existing or customized OCR models via the uniﬁed\nAPI provided in the OCR module. 4) LayoutParser comes with a set of utility\nfunctions for the visualization and storage of the layout data. 5) LayoutParser\nis also highly customizable, via its integration with functions for layout data\nannotation and model training. We now provide detailed descriptions for each\ncomponent.\n\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\n\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\n\n1 import layoutparser as lp\n2 image = cv2 . imread ( " image_file " ) # load images\n3 model = lp . De t e c tro n2 Lay outM odel (\n\n" lp :// PubLayNet / f as t er _ r c nn _ R _ 50 _ F P N_ 3 x / config " )\n\n4\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\n\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\ndatasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.\n\x0c6\n\nZ.

They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for\nmaximum ﬂexibility.\n\nShown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained\non
