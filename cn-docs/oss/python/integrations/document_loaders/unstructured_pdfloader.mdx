Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\n\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis · Deep Learning · Layout Analysis · Character Recognition · Open Source library · Toolkit.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [11,\n\n2\n\nZ. Shen et al.\n\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4]. A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the manual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.\n\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image analysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser is built with the following components:\n\n1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character recognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\n\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that underlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\n\n3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model tuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\n\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu- tion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability, reproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\n\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing generalizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient functions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with existing DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated tutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to advances in applications in both industry and academic research.\n\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model reusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com- puter vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show LayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects\n\nLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\n\nthat require precision, eﬃciency, and robustness, as well as simple and light- weight document processing tasks focusing on eﬃcacy and ﬂexibility (Section 5). LayoutParser is being actively maintained, and support for more deep learning models and novel methods in text-based layout analysis methods [37, 34] is planned.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work. The core LayoutParser library, DL Model Zoo, and customized model training are described in Section 3, and the DL model hub and commu- nity platform are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 shows two examples of how LayoutParser can be used in practical DIA projects, and Section 6 concludes.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nRecently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis tasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen- tation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38] and detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also been used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented individually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\n\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document image processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M relevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods or provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the OCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However, similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for analyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models. The DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9 and Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document Analysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2] aim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they are not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and paddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other DIA tasks like layout analysis.\n\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting reproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL. Libraries like Dectectron2 [35],\n\n6 The number shown is obtained by specifying the search type as ‘code’. 7 https://ocr-d.de/en/about 8 https://github.com/BobLd/DocumentLayoutAnalysis 9 https://github.com/leonlulu/DeepLayout 10 https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2 11 https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR 12 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR\n\n3\n\n4\n\nZ.

For an input document image, the core LayoutParser library provides a set of oﬀ-the-shelf tools for layout detection, OCR, visualization, and storage, backed by a carefully designed layout data structure. LayoutParser also supports high level customization via eﬃcient layout annotation and model training functions. These improve model accuracy on the target samples. The community platform enables the easy sharing of DIA models and whole digitization pipelines to promote reusability and reproducibility. A collection of detailed documentation, tutorials and exemplar projects make LayoutParser easy to learn and use.\n\nAllenNLP [8] and transformers [34] have provided the community with complete DL-based support for developing and deploying models for general computer vision and natural language processing problems. LayoutParser, on the other hand, specializes speciﬁcally in DIA tasks. LayoutParser is also equipped with a community platform inspired by established model hubs such as Torch Hub [23] and TensorFlow Hub [1]. It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as full document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.\n\nThere have been a variety of document data collections to facilitate the development of DL models. Some examples include PRImA [3](magazine layouts), PubLayNet [38](academic paper layouts), Table Bank [18](tables in academic papers), Newspaper Navigator Dataset [16, 17](newspaper ﬁgure layouts) and HJDataset [31](historical Japanese document layouts). A spectrum of models trained on these datasets are currently available in the LayoutParser model zoo to support diﬀerent use cases.\n\n3 The Core LayoutParser Library\n\nAt the core of LayoutParser is an oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit that streamlines DL- based document image analysis. Five components support a simple interface with comprehensive functionalities: 1) The layout detection models enable using pre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines of code. 2) The detected layout information is stored in carefully engineered\n\nLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\n\nTable 1: Current layout detection models in the LayoutParser model zoo\n\nDataset\n\nBase Model1 Large Model Notes\n\nPubLayNet [38] PRImA [3] Newspaper [17] TableBank [18] HJDataset [31]\n\nF / M M F F F / M\n\nM - - F -\n\nLayouts of modern scientiﬁc documents Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientiﬁc reports Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century Table region on modern scientiﬁc and business document Layouts of history Japanese documents\n\n1 For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy vs. computational cost). For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101 backbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask R-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained using the ResNet 101 backbone. The platform is maintained and a number of additions will be made to the model zoo in coming months.\n\nlayout data structures, which are optimized for eﬃciency and versatility. 3) When necessary, users can employ existing or customized OCR models via the uniﬁed API provided in the OCR module. 4) LayoutParser comes with a set of utility functions for the visualization and storage of the layout data. 5) LayoutParser is also highly customizable, via its integration with functions for layout data annotation and model training. We now provide detailed descriptions for each component.\n\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\n\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and generates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection. LayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\n\n1 import layoutparser as lp 2 image = cv2 . imread ( " image_file " ) # load images 3 model = lp . De t e c tro n2 Lay outM odel (\n\n" lp :// PubLayNet / f as t er _ r c nn _ R _ 50 _ F P N_ 3 x / config " )\n\n4 5 layout = model . detect ( image )\n\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various datasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to domain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap- plied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As document structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset name and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nZ. Shen et al.\n\nFig. 2: The relationship between the three types of layout data structures. Coordinate supports three kinds of variation; TextBlock consists of the co- ordinate information and extra features like block text, types, and reading orders; a Layout object is a list of all possible layout elements, including other Layout objects. They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for maximum ﬂexibility.\n\nShown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained on 5 diﬀerent datasets. Description of the training dataset is provided alongside with the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable models for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available, LayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community sharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).\n\n3.2 Layout Data Structures\n\nA critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data structures and operations that can be used to eﬃciently process and manipulate the layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing on the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading the results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be stored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which makes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within LayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely the Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide diﬀerent levels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for transformations or operations on these classes.\n\nLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\n\nCoordinates are the cornerstones for storing layout information. Currently, three types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser, shown in Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and support specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized with 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support a
