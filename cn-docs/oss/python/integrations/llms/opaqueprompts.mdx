[OpaquePrompts](https://opaqueprompts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 是一项服务，它使应用程序能够利用语言模型的能力，同时不损害用户隐私。OpaquePrompts 专为可组合性和易于集成到现有应用程序与服务中而设计，可通过简单的 Python 库以及 LangChain 来使用。或许更重要的是，OpaquePrompts 利用了[机密计算](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing)的能力，以确保即使是 OpaquePrompts 服务本身也无法访问其正在保护的数据。

本笔记本将介绍如何使用 LangChain 与 `OpaquePrompts` 进行交互。

```python
# 安装 opaqueprompts 和 langchain 包
pip install -qU  opaqueprompts langchain
```

访问 OpaquePrompts API 需要一个 API 密钥，您可以通过在 [OpaquePrompts 网站](https://opaqueprompts.opaque.co/) 上创建账户来获取。拥有账户后，您可以在 [API 密钥页面](https:opaqueprompts.opaque.co/api-keys) 找到您的 API 密钥。

```python
import os

# 设置 API 密钥

os.environ["OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY"] = "<OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY>"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

# 使用 OpaquePrompts LLM 包装器

将 OpaquePrompts 应用到您的应用程序可以非常简单，只需使用 OpaquePrompts 类包装您的 LLM，将 `llm=OpenAI()` 替换为 `llm=OpaquePrompts(base_llm=OpenAI())`。

```python
from langchain_classic.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.globals import set_debug, set_verbose
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
from langchain_community.llms import OpaquePrompts
from langchain_core.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

set_debug(True)
set_verbose(True)

prompt_template = """
As an AI assistant, you will answer questions according to given context.

Sensitive personal information in the question is masked for privacy.
For instance, if the original text says "Giana is good," it will be changed
to "PERSON_998 is good."

Here's how to handle these changes:
* Consider these masked phrases just as placeholders, but still refer to
them in a relevant way when answering.
* It's possible that different masked terms might mean the same thing.
Stick with the given term and don't modify it.
* All masked terms follow the "TYPE_ID" pattern.
* Please don't invent new masked terms. For instance, if you see "PERSON_998,"
don't come up with "PERSON_997" or "PERSON_999" unless they're already in the question.

OpaquePrompts 将自动检测敏感数据并用占位符替换它。

# OpaquePrompts 处理后的上下文

During our recent meeting on DATE_TIME_3, at DATE_TIME_2, PERSON_3 provided me with his personal details. His email is EMAIL_ADDRESS_1 and his contact number is PHONE_NUMBER_1. He lives in LOCATION_3, LOCATION_2, and belongs to the NRP_3 nationality with NRP_2 beliefs and a leaning towards the Democratic party. He mentioned that he recently made a transaction using his credit card CREDIT_CARD_1 and transferred bitcoins to the wallet address CRYPTO_1. While discussing his NRP_1 travels, he noted down his IBAN as IBAN_CODE_1. Additionally, he provided his website as URL_1. PERSON_2 also discussed some of his LOCATION_1-specific details. He said his bank account number is US_BANK_NUMBER_1 and his drivers license is US_DRIVER_LICENSE_2. His ITIN is US_ITIN_1, and he recently renewed his passport, the number for which is DATE_TIME_1. He emphasized not to share his SSN, which is US_SSN_1. Furthermore, he mentioned that he accesses his work files remotely through the IP IP_ADDRESS_1 and has a medical license number MED-US_DRIVER_LICENSE_1.
```

占位符被用于 LLM 的响应中。

```
# LLM 返回的响应

Hey PERSON_1, just wanted to remind you to do a password reset for your website URL_1 through your email EMAIL_ADDRESS_1. It's important to stay secure online, so don't forget to do it!
```

响应通过将占位符替换为原始敏感数据来进行去敏化处理。

```
# 来自 OpaquePrompts 的去敏化 LLM 响应

Hey John, just wanted to remind you to do a password reset for your website https://johndoeportfolio.com through your email johndoe@example.com. It's important to stay secure online, so don't forget to do it!

# 在 LangChain 表达式中使用 OpaquePrompts

如果直接替换无法提供您所需的灵活性，也有一些函数可以与 LangChain 表达式一起使用。

```python
import langchain_community.utilities.opaqueprompts as op
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

prompt = (PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template),)
llm = OpenAI()
pg_chain = (
    op.sanitize
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign(
        response=(lambda x: x["sanitized_input"]) | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser(),
    )
    | (lambda x: op.desanitize(x["response"], x["secure_context"]))
)

pg_chain.invoke(
    {
        "question": "Write a text message to remind John to do password reset for his website through his email to stay secure.",
        "history": "",
    }
)
```
