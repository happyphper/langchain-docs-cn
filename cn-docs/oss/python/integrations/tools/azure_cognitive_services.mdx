title: Azure 认知服务工具包
---
该工具包用于与 `Azure Cognitive Services API` 交互，以实现一些多模态功能。

目前此工具包中捆绑了四个工具：

- AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool：用于从图像中提取标题、对象、标签和文本。（注意：由于依赖 `azure-ai-vision` 包，该工具目前在 Mac OS 上尚不可用，该包目前仅支持 Windows 和 Linux。）
- AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool：用于从文档中提取文本、表格和键值对。
- AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool：用于将语音转录为文本。
- AzureCogsText2SpeechTool：用于将文本合成为语音。
- AzureCogsTextAnalyticsHealthTool：用于提取医疗健康实体。

首先，您需要设置一个 Azure 账户并创建一个认知服务资源。您可以按照[此处](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows)的说明来创建资源。

然后，您需要获取资源的终结点、密钥和区域，并将它们设置为环境变量。您可以在资源的“密钥和终结点”页面找到它们。

```python
pip install -qU  azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-ai-textanalytics > /dev/null

# For Windows/Linux
pip install -qU  azure-ai-vision > /dev/null
```

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-"
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_REGION"] = ""
```

## 创建工具包

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()
```

```python
[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]
```

```python
['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']
```

## 在智能体中使用

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
agent.run(
    "What can I make with these ingredients?"
    "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
)
```
