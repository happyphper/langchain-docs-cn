### 凭证

我们还需要设置 Tavily API 密钥。您可以通过访问[此网站](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in)并创建账户来获取 API 密钥。

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("TAVILY_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Tavily API key:\n")
```

## 实例化

该工具在实例化时接受各种参数：

- `extract_depth` (可选, str): 提取深度，可以是 "basic" 或 "advanced"。默认为 "basic"。
- `include_images` (可选, bool): 是否在提取中包含图片。默认为 False。

有关可用参数的完整概述，请参阅 [Tavily Extract API 文档](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/extract)

```python
from langchain_tavily import TavilyExtract

tool = TavilyExtract(
    extract_depth="basic",
    include_images=False,
)
```

## 调用

### [直接使用参数调用](/oss/langchain/tools)

Tavily 提取工具在调用时接受以下参数：

- `urls` (必需): 要从中提取内容的 URL 列表。
- `extract_depth` 和 `include_images` 也可以在调用时设置

注意：可选参数可供智能体动态设置。如果您在实例化时设置了参数，然后在调用工具时传递了不同的值，工具将使用您在调用时传递的值。

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d\'Or awards and four the Best FIFA Men\'s Player awards.[note 2] He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies,[note 3] including twelve league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most assists (18) and goal contributions (32) in the Copa América, most goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (191) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals and has provided over 380 assists for club and country.[16]\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballons d\'Or, and by the 2011–12 season he would set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season and establish himself as Barcelona\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. However, he regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d\'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona\'s captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d\'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined Major League Soccer club Inter Miami in July 2023.\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team\'s all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in 2006. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he then led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina\'s 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d\'Or that year. He then led Argentina to win the 2022 Finalissima, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his country\'s third overall world championship and first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d\'Or in 2023, and a victory in the 2024 Copa América.\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d\'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1\xa0billion
