## 设置

要使用 `PDFLoader` 文档加载器，你需要安装 `@langchain/community` 集成包以及 `pdf-parse` 包。

### 凭证

### 安装

LangChain PDFLoader 集成位于 `@langchain/community` 包中：

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
</CodeGroup>

## 实例化

现在我们可以实例化模型对象并加载文档：

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf"

const nike10kPdfPath = "../../../../data/nke-10k-2023.pdf"

const loader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath)
```

## 加载

```typescript
const docs = await loader.load()
docs[0]
```

```javascript

## 用法，每个文件一个文档

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const singleDocPerFileLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  splitPages: false,
});

const singleDoc = await singleDocPerFileLoader.load();
console.log(singleDoc[0].pageContent.slice(0, 100))
```

```text
Table of Contents
UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
FORM 10-K
```

## 用法，自定义 `pdfjs` 构建

默认情况下，我们使用 `pdf-parse` 捆绑的 `pdfjs` 构建，它与大多数环境兼容，包括 Node.js 和现代浏览器。如果你想使用更新版本的 `pdfjs-dist`，或者想使用自定义构建的 `pdfjs-dist`，可以通过提供一个自定义的 `pdfjs` 函数来实现，该函数返回一个解析为 `PDFJS` 对象的 Promise。

在下面的示例中，我们使用了 `pdfjs-dist` 的“遗留”版本（参见 [pdfjs 文档](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsersenvironments-are-supported)），该版本包含了一些默认构建中没有的 polyfill。

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install pdfjs-dist
```
```bash yarn
yarn add pdfjs-dist
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add pdfjs-dist
```
</CodeGroup>


```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const customBuildLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  // 你可能需要在导入语句末尾添加 `.then(m => m.default)`
  // @lc-ts-ignore
  pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});
```

## 消除多余空格

PDF 文件种类繁多，这使得读取它们成为一项挑战。加载器默认解析单个文本元素并用空格将它们连接起来，但如果你看到过多的空格，这可能不是期望的行为。在这种情况下，你可以像这样用空字符串覆盖分隔符：

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const noExtraSpacesLoader = new PDFLoader(nike10kPdfPath, {
  parsedItemSeparator: "",
});

const noExtraSpacesDocs = await noExtraSpacesLoader.load();
console.log(noExtraSpacesDocs[0].pageContent.slice(100, 250))
```

```text
(Mark One)
☑ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2023
OR
☐ TRANSITI
```

## 加载目录

```typescript
import { DirectoryLoader } from "@langchain/classic/document_loaders/fs/directory";
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

const exampleDataPath = "../../../../../../examples/src/document_loaders/example_data/";

/* 加载指定目录内的所有 PDF 文件 */
const directoryLoader = new DirectoryLoader(
  exampleDataPath,
  {
    ".pdf": (path: string) => new PDFLoader(path),
  }
);

const directoryDocs = await directoryLoader.load();

console.log(directoryDocs[0]);

/* 附加步骤：使用任何 TextSplitter 将文本分割成块。然后你可以将其用作上下文或之后保存到内存中。 */
const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});

const splitDocs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(directoryDocs);
console.log(splitDocs[0]);

    'reversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must \n' +
    'be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. \n' +
    'A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties \n' +
    'can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments \n' +
    'over a communications channel without a trusted party.\n' +
