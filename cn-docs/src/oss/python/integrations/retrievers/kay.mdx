>[Kai Data API](https://www.kay.ai/) 专为 RAG 🕵️ 构建。我们正在整理世界上最大的数据集，将其转化为高质量的嵌入向量，以便您的 AI 代理能够动态检索上下文。我们提供最新的模型、快速的检索能力，并且无需基础设施。

本笔记本将向您展示如何检索 [Kay](https://kay.ai/) 支持的数据集。目前，您可以搜索 `SEC 文件` 和 `美国公司的新闻稿`。请访问 [kay.ai](https://kay.ai) 获取最新的数据更新。如有任何问题，请加入我们的 [Discord](https://discord.gg/hAnE4e5T6M) 或 [在 Twitter 上联系我们](https://twitter.com/vishalrohra_)。

## 安装

首先，安装 [`kay` 包](https://pypi.org/project/kay/)。

```python
!pip install kay
```

您还需要一个 API 密钥：您可以在 [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/) 免费获取一个。获得 API 密钥后，必须将其设置为环境变量 `KAY_API_KEY`。

`KayAiRetriever` 有一个静态的 `.create()` 工厂方法，它接受以下参数：

* `dataset_id: string` 必需 -- Kay 数据集 ID。这是一个关于特定实体（如公司、人员或地点）的数据集合。例如，可以尝试 `"company"`。
* `data_type: List[string]` 可选 -- 这是数据集中基于其来源或格式的类别，例如“公司”数据集中的‘SEC 文件’、‘新闻稿’或‘报告’。例如，可以尝试“公司”数据集下的 ["10-K", "10-Q", "PressRelease"]。如果留空，Kay 将检索所有类型中最相关的上下文。
* `num_contexts: int` 可选，默认为 6 -- 每次调用 `get_relevant_documents()` 时要检索的文档块数量。

## 示例

### 基本检索器用法

```python
# 设置 API 密钥
from getpass import getpass

KAY_API_KEY = getpass()
```

```python
import os

from langchain_community.retrievers import KayAiRetriever

retriever = KayAiRetriever.create(
    dataset_id="company", data_types=["10-K", "10-Q", "PressRelease"], num_contexts=3
)
docs = retriever.invoke(
    "What were the biggest strategy changes and partnerships made by Roku in 2023??"

-> **Question**: What were the biggest strategy changes and partnerships made by Roku in 2023?

**Answer**: In 2023, Roku made a strategic partnership with FreeWheel to bring Roku's leading ad tech to FreeWheel customers. This partnership aimed to drive greater interoperability and automation in the advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) space. Key highlights of this collaboration include streamlined integration of Roku's demand application programming interface (dAPI) with FreeWheel's TV platform, allowing for better inventory quality control and improved publisher yield and revenue. Additionally, publishers can now use Roku platform signals to enable advertisers to target audiences and measure campaign performance without relying on cookies. This partnership also involves the use of data clean room technology to enable the activation of additional data sets for better measurement and monetization for publishers and agencies. These partnerships and strategies aim to support Roku's growth in the AVOD market.
