## 设置

langchain-gradient 使用 DigitalOcean Gradient 平台。

在 DigitalOcean 上创建一个账户，从 Gradient 平台获取 `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` API 密钥，并安装 `langchain-gradient` 集成包。

### 凭证

前往 [DigitalOcean 登录](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login)

1.  注册/登录 DigitalOcean 云控制台
2.  进入 Gradient 平台并导航到 Serverless Inference。
3.  点击 Create model access key，输入名称，然后创建密钥。

完成此操作后，设置 `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` 环境变量：

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY"):
    os.environ["DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY"] = getpass.getpass(
        "Enter your DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY API key: "
    )
```

如果您希望自动追踪模型调用，也可以通过取消注释以下代码来设置您的 [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home) API 密钥：

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
```

### 安装

DigitalOcean Gradient 集成位于 `langchain-gradient` 包中：

```python
pip install -qU langchain-gradient
```

## 实例化

现在我们可以实例化我们的模型对象并生成聊天补全：

```python
from langchain_gradient import ChatGradient

llm = ChatGradient(
    model="llama3.3-70b-instruct",
    # 其他参数...
)
```

## 调用

```python
messages = [
    (
        "system",
        "You are a creative storyteller. Continue any story prompt you receive in an engaging and imaginative way.",
    ),
    (
        "human",
        "Once upon a time, in a village at the edge of a mysterious forest, a young girl named Mira found a glowing stone...",
    ),
]
ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
ai_msg
```

```text

As soon as Mira's fingers made contact with the stone, she felt an sudden surge of energy course through her veins, like a river bursting its banks. The stone, which had been dull and lifeless just moments before, now pulsed with a soft, ethereal light, as if it had been awakened by Mira's touch.\n\nIntrigued, Mira turned the stone over in her hand, studying it from every angle. The light emanating from it cast eerie shadows on the trees around her, making her feel as though she was standing at the threshold of a secret world. As she gazed deeper into the stone, she began to notice that the glow was not just a random color, but a deep, rich blue that seemed to be calling to her.\n\nWithout thinking, Mira felt an overwhelming urge to follow the stone's gentle glow, which seemed to be leading her deeper into the mysterious forest. The trees loomed above her, their branches creaking and swaying in the wind, as if they too were urging her onward. The air was filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers and the soft hooting of owls, creating a sense of enchantment that was both exhilarating and unsettling.\n\nAs Mira wandered deeper into the forest, the stone's light grew brighter, illuminating a winding path that was all but invisible in the fading light of day. The trees grew taller and closer together here, forming a tunnel of foliage that seemed to be guiding her towards a hidden destination.

The air was filled with a faint humming noise, like the buzzing of a thousand bees, and the stone in her hand pulsed with an otherworldly energy. In the center of the clearing stood an enormous tree, its trunk twisted and gnarled with age, its branches reaching up towards the stars like a Nature's own cathedral.\n\nMira felt a sense of awe wash over her, as she approached the tree, the stone still clutched in her hand. She could feel the magic of the forest pulsing through her, calling to her, drawing her closer to the heart of the mystery.

## 链式调用

我们可以像这样将我们的模型与提示模板链式调用：

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        (
            "system",
            'You are a knowledgeable assistant. Carefully read the provided context and answer the user\'s question. If the answer is present in the context, cite the relevant sentence. If not, reply with "Not found in context."',
        ),
        ("human", "Context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | llm
chain.invoke(
    {
        "context": (
            "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris and was completed in 1889. "
            "It was designed by Gustave Eiffel's engineering company. "
            "The tower is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. "
            "The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States."
        ),
        "question": "Who designed the Eiffel Tower and when was it completed?",
    }
)
```

```text
AIMessage(content='The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel\'s engineering company and was completed in 1889. (Sentence: "It was designed by Gustave Eiffel\'s engineering company. The tower is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. ...  The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris and was completed in 1889.")', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop'}, id='run--c23ffab6-06ae-4130-87b1-d5b2e7744906-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 153, 'output_tokens': 74, 'total_tokens': 227})
