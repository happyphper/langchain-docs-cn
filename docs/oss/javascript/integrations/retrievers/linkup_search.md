> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) 提供了一个 API，用于将 LLM 连接到网络以及 Linkup 高级合作伙伴数据源。

本文将帮助你开始使用 LinkupSearchRetriever [检索器](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval/)。有关 LinkupSearchRetriever 所有功能和配置的详细文档，请参阅 [API 参考](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html)。

### 集成详情

| 检索器 | 数据源 | 包 |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
[LinkupSearchRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html) | 网络及合作伙伴数据源 | langchain-linkup |

## 设置

要使用 Linkup 服务提供商，你需要一个有效的 API 密钥，你可以通过[在此处](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up)注册获取。然后你可以将其设置为 `LINKUP_API_KEY` 环境变量。对于下面的链式示例，你还需要设置一个 OpenAI API 密钥作为 `OPENAI_API_KEY` 环境变量，你也可以在这里完成：

```python
# import os
# os.environ["LINKUP_API_KEY"] = ""  # 填入你的 API 密钥
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""  # 填入你的 API 密钥
```

如果你想从单个查询中获得自动化追踪，也可以通过取消注释以下代码来设置你的 [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home) API 密钥：

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### 安装

此检索器位于 `langchain-linkup` 包中：

```python
pip install -qU langchain-linkup
```

## 实例化

现在我们可以实例化我们的检索器：

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" 或 "deep"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API 密钥可以在此处传入，也可以设置为 LINKUP_API_KEY 环境变量
)
```

## 使用

```python
query = "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"

retriever.invoke(query)
```
