[Needle](https://needle-ai.com) 让您能够轻松创建 RAG 管道，只需付出最少的努力。

更多详细信息，请参阅我们的 [API 文档](https://docs.needle-ai.com/docs/api-reference/needle-api)

## 概述

Needle 文档加载器是一个用于将 Needle 集合与 LangChain 集成的工具。它支持在检索增强生成 (RAG) 工作流中无缝存储、检索和利用文档。

本示例演示了：

*   将文档存储到 Needle 集合中。
*   设置检索器以获取文档。
*   构建检索增强生成 (RAG) 管道。

### 设置

开始之前，请确保设置了以下环境变量：

*   `NEEDLE_API_KEY`：用于与 Needle 进行身份验证的 API 密钥。
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`：用于语言模型操作的 OpenAI API 密钥。

## 初始化

要初始化 NeedleLoader，您需要以下参数：

*   `needle_api_key`：您的 Needle API 密钥（或将其设置为环境变量）。
*   `collection_id`：要操作的 Needle 集合的 ID。

```python
import os
```

```python
os.environ["NEEDLE_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## 实例化

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.needle import NeedleLoader

collection_id = "clt_01J87M9T6B71DHZTHNXYZQRG5H"

# 初始化 NeedleLoader 以将文档存储到集合中
document_loader = NeedleLoader(
    needle_api_key=os.getenv("NEEDLE_API_KEY"),
    collection_id=collection_id,
)
```

## 加载

要将文件添加到 Needle 集合：

```python
files = {
    "tech-radar-30.pdf": "https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2024/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_30_en.pdf"
}

document_loader.add_files(files=files)
```

```python
# 显示集合中的文档
# collections_documents = document_loader.load()
```

## 使用

### 在链中使用

以下是在链中使用 Needle 设置 RAG 管道的完整示例：

```python
import os

from langchain_classic.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain_classic.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
from langchain_community.retrievers.needle import NeedleRetriever
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# 初始化 Needle 检索器（确保您的 Needle API 密钥已设置为环境变量）
retriever = NeedleRetriever(
    needle_api_key=os.getenv("NEEDLE_API_KEY"),
    collection_id="clt_01J87M9T6B71DHZTHNXYZQRG5H",
)

# 定义助手的系统提示
system_prompt = """
    You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
    Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
    If you don't know, say so concisely.\n\n{context}
    """

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", system_prompt), ("human", "{input}")]
)

# 使用文档链（stuff chain）和检索器定义问答链
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)

# 通过组合检索器和问答链来创建 RAG（检索增强生成）链
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)

# 定义输入查询
query = {"input": "Did RAG move to accepted?"}

response = rag_chain.invoke(query)

response
```
