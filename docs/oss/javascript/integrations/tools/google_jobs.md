本笔记本将介绍如何使用 Google Jobs 工具来获取当前的职位发布信息。

首先，您需要在 [serpapi.com/users/sign_up](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up) 注册一个 `SerpApi key`，并在此处获取您的 API 密钥：[serpapi.com/manage-api-key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key)。

然后，您需要使用以下命令安装 `google-search-results`：
`pip install google-search-results`

接着，您需要将环境变量 `SERPAPI_API_KEY` 设置为您的 `SerpApi key`。

如果您使用的是 conda 环境，可以在内核中使用以下命令进行设置：
conda activate [您的环境名称]
conda env config vars SERPAPI_API_KEY='[您的 serp api 密钥]'

## 使用该工具

```python
pip install -qU google-search-results langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
from langchain_community.tools.google_jobs import GoogleJobsQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities.google_jobs import GoogleJobsAPIWrapper

tool = GoogleJobsQueryRun(api_wrapper=GoogleJobsAPIWrapper())
```

```python
tool.run("Can I get an entry level job posting related to physics")
