title: 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）备案文件
---
>[SEC 文件](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) 是提交给美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的财务报表或其他正式文件。上市公司、特定内部人士和经纪交易商需要定期提交 `SEC 文件`。投资者和金融专业人士依靠这些文件来获取他们为投资目的所评估公司的信息。

`SEC 文件` 数据由 [Kay.ai](https://kay.ai) 和 [Cybersyn](https://www.cybersyn.com/) 通过 [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZTSZAS2KCS/Cybersyn%2C%20Inc.) 提供。

## 设置

首先，你需要安装 `kay` 包。你还需要一个 API 密钥：你可以在 [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/) 免费获取一个。获取 API 密钥后，必须将其设置为环境变量 `KAY_API_KEY`。

在这个例子中，我们将使用 `KayAiRetriever`。查看 [kay notebook](/oss/integrations/retrievers/kay) 以获取其接受参数的更详细信息。

```python
# Setup API keys for Kay and OpenAI
from getpass import getpass

KAY_API_KEY = getpass()
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()
```

```text
········
········
```

```python
import os

os.environ["KAY_API_KEY"] = KAY_API_KEY
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## 示例

```python
from langchain_classic.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain_community.retrievers import KayAiRetriever
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
retriever = KayAiRetriever.create(
    dataset_id="company", data_types=["10-K", "10-Q"], num_contexts=6
)
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model, retriever=retriever)
```

```python
questions = [
    "What are patterns in Nvidia's spend over the past three quarters?",
    # "What are some recent challenges faced by the renewable energy sector?",
]
chat_history = []

for question in questions:
    result = qa({"question": question, "chat_history": chat_history})
    chat_history.append((question, result["answer"]))
    print(f"-> **Question**: {question} \n")
    print(f"**Answer**: {result['answer']} \n")
```

```text
