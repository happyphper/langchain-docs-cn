> 从聊天历史中回忆、理解并提取数据。为个性化 AI 体验提供动力。

> [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) 是一个为 AI 助手应用设计的长时记忆服务。
> 通过 Zep，您可以让 AI 助手具备回忆过去对话的能力，无论对话发生在多久以前，
> 同时还能减少幻觉、降低延迟和成本。

> 对 Zep Cloud 感兴趣？请参阅 [Zep Cloud 安装指南](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) 和 [Zep Cloud 向量存储示例](https://help.getzep.com/langchain/examples/vectorstore-example)

## 开源安装与设置

> Zep 开源项目：[https://github.com/getzep/zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep)
>
> Zep 开源文档：[https://docs.getzep.com/](https://docs.getzep.com/)

您需要安装 `langchain-community`，使用 `pip install -qU langchain-community` 来使用此集成。

## 用法

在下面的示例中，我们使用 Zep 的自动嵌入功能，该功能使用低延迟嵌入模型在 Zep 服务器上自动嵌入文档。

## 注意

- 这些示例使用 Zep 的异步接口。通过移除方法名中的 `a` 前缀来调用同步接口。
- 如果您传入一个 <a href="https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/embeddings/#langchain_core.embeddings.embeddings.Embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link"><code>Embeddings</code></a> 实例，Zep 将使用它来嵌入文档，而不是自动嵌入。您还必须将您的文档集合设置为 `isAutoEmbedded === false`。
- 如果您将集合设置为 `isAutoEmbedded === false`，则必须传入一个 <a href="https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/embeddings/#langchain_core.embeddings.embeddings.Embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link"><code>Embeddings</code></a> 实例。

## 从文档加载或创建集合

```python
from uuid import uuid4

from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ZepVectorStore
from langchain_community.vectorstores.zep import CollectionConfig
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

ZEP_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # 这是您的 Zep 实例的 API URL
ZEP_API_KEY = "<optional_key>"  # 您的 Zep 实例的可选 API 密钥
collection_name = f"babbage{uuid4().hex}"  # 唯一的集合名称。仅限字母数字

# 如果我们要创建一个新的 Zep 集合，则需要集合配置
config = CollectionConfig(
    name=collection_name,
    description="<optional description>",
    metadata={"optional_metadata": "associated with the collection"},
    is_auto_embedded=True,  # 我们将让 Zep 使用其低延迟嵌入器嵌入我们的文档
    embedding_dimensions=1536,  # 这应与您为 Zep 配置使用的模型匹配。
)

# 加载文档
article_url = "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/71292/pg71292.txt"
loader = WebBaseLoader(article_url)
documents = loader.load()

# 将其分割成块
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# 实例化 VectorStore。由于该集合在 Zep 中尚不存在，
# 它将被创建并用我们传入的文档填充。
vs = ZepVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    collection_name=collection_name,
    config=config,
    api_url=ZEP_API_URL,
    api_key=ZEP_API_KEY,
    embedding=None,  # 我们将让 Zep 使用其低延迟嵌入器嵌入我们的文档
)
```

```python
# 等待集合嵌入完成

async def wait_for_ready(collection_name: str) -> None:
    import time

    from zep_python import ZepClient

    client = ZepClient(ZEP_API_URL, ZEP_API_KEY)

    while True:
        c = await client.document.aget_collection(collection_name)
        print(
            "嵌入状态: "
            f"{c.document_embedded_count}/{c.document_count} 个文档已嵌入"
        )
        time.sleep(1)
        if c.status == "ready":
            break

await wait_for_ready(collection_name)

## 在集合上进行相似性搜索查询

```python
# 查询它
query = "what is the structure of our solar system?"
docs_scores = await vs.asimilarity_search_with_relevance_scores(query, k=3)

# 打印结果
